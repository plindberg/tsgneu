If I look at coding, programming – which is one area where AI is making the most progress – what we are finding is we are not far from a world – I think we are going to be there in three to six months, where AI is writing ninety percent of the code – and then in twelve months we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code.

But the programmers still needs to specify, you know, what are the conditions of what you’re doing, what is the overall app you’re trying to make, what’s the overall design decision, how do we collaborate with other code that’s been written – you know, how do we have some common sense on whether this is a secure design or an insecure design.

So as long as there are these small pieces that a programmer, a human programmer, needs to do – the AI isn’t good at – I think human productivity will actually be enhanced. But on the other hand, I think that eventually all those little island will get picked off by AI systems – and then we will eventually reach the point where, you know, the AIs can do everything that humans can. And I think that will happen in every industry.
