title: I’m doing company admin today …
---
<p>I’m doing company admin today – tasks I’ve had rough checklists for over the years.
  Some months ago, I rewrote them in detail, mainly to document the process for Svante,
  who runs the company with me. Some tasks overlapped with his checklists, but others
  were things I’d handled without explaining how. Documenting them made sense. What I
  didn’t expect – given that I already had checklists – was how much more efficient the
  work has become – less cognitive load and it takes less time.
