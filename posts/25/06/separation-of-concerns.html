title: Separation of concerns
---
<p>Say you’re writing a function or method. What does it do? It takes some input, returns
  some output based on some computation – or maybe changes some state. Are the inputs and
  outputs related? Do they make sense together? If not they should be separate.<sup>1</sup>

<aside role="note" class="text-base/7">
  <sup>1</sup> This was a reply on Threads. The above paragraph comes across as just being
    about the inputs and outputs (or mutated state). Rather, it has to do with what is done
    based on the inputs, and how it affects the outputs. Do those things make sense together
    or apart?
</aside>

<p>This happens at all scales: within functions (separating by blank lines), within a group
  of functions (should they be together or apart), within a file, within a class, module,
  subsystem, and so on.

<p>Separating things means making decisions about who gets to access what – call a function,
  read or write some state – and even more subtle, who gets to know that some other part
  even exists.

<p>This has significant effect on the quality of software – how easy it is to understand and
  to change and how well it allows to keep complexity in check.
