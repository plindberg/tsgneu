With LLMs in software development, the hope is to be able to make software at higher levels.

A tension here is the seemingly {% link "/25/09/agentic-coding-inevitable-detail-making-software/" %}inevitable level of detail{% endlink %} for many kinds of software â€“ certainly of not software that matters.
