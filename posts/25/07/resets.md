A reset is a brief pause that helps your body and mind recover and refocus.

It’s not simply about resting – it’s about deliberately stepping back from what you’re doing, so you can return with greater clarity, energy, and focus.

A proper reset settles your nervous system, clears mental fog, and helps you change direction – whether you’re getting started, feeling stuck, or finishing up.
