<p>From {% acite "https://hbr.org/2023/01/how-frank-gehry-delivers-on-time-and-on-budget" %}How Frank Gehry delivers on time and on budget{% endacite %}:

{% blockquote "https://hbr.org/2023/01/how-frank-gehry-delivers-on-time-and-on-budget" %}
  <p>When projects are launched without detailed and rigorous plans, issues are left
    unresolved that will resurface during delivery, causing delays, cost overruns,
    and breakdowns. […]

  <p>Gehry and his team had spent two years up front thinking through and simulating every detail,
    in effect building the museum on computers before they built it in reality. […]

  <p>Relatively speaking, planning is cheap, delivery is expensive.
{% endblockquote %}

<p>There was a time when we thought this was the case for software projects. We, on the other hand,
  want to move to delivery as soon as possible, and capture the details in code, not plans.
