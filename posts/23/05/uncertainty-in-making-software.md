Making software, you can’t be sure of anything until it’s in the hands of your users, and you can tell that they understand what it enables them to do, and that it has the desired effects on your business.

Talking to users and drawing the UI in Figma doesn’t make this not true.

We do many things in a software project to gain certainty: do research, draw designs, write specs, discuss things, estimate the effort to implement – and how all this don’t make things as certain as we feel they are. I think it would be a good thing to recognise this uncertainty.
