Making software is an exploration. Like hiking in the mountains, sometimes you are in an open landscape: you can see where you are going and you can see where you have been and how long it took to get to where you are now.

At other times, you can see a steep climb, and then you can’t know how long it will take to complete the next stage of your trip, and how much effort – or even if you’ll have to turn back and take another route.

At yet other times, your vision will be obscured, so you know nothing about what lies ahead.

Also, in making software there are no maps.
