  <p>Hello there,
  <p>I’m Peter (Lindberg), a software developer living in Stockholm, Sweden.
  <p>I’ve been working in software for over 30 years, mainly as a contractor or freelancer,
    with over 25 companies in various industries and technical contexts.
  <p>With a friend, I run a consultancy called Fleecelabs.
  <p>Currently, I’m working on a personal finance app called Lång – now in early testing.
    It helps people who don’t budget spend with confidence. You can

    you’re interested.
  <p>Aside from that, I’ve mostly been preoccupied with these things lately:

    <li>Large language models
    <li>The history of ideas
    <li>Maigret novels
  </ul>
