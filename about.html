  <p>Hello there,
  <p>I’m Peter (Lindberg), a software developer living in Stockholm, Sweden.
  <p>I’ve been working in software for over 30 years, mainly as a contractor or freelancer,
    with over 25 companies in various industries and technical contexts.
  <p>With a friend, I run a consultancy called <a href="https://fleecelabs.se" class="underline">Fleecelabs</a>.
  <p>Currently, I’m working on a personal finance app called Lång – now in early testing.
    It helps people who don’t budget spend with confidence. You can
    <a href="https://lang.money/download?ref=tsgn" class="underline">get it from the App Store</a> if
    you’re interested.
  <p>Aside from that, I’ve mostly been preoccupied with these things lately:
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 sm:pl-0">
    <li>Large language models
    <li>The history of ideas
    <li>Maigret novels
  </ul>
  <p>This is my homepage. It has <a href="/feed" type="application/rss+xml" rel="alternate" class="underline">an RSS feed</a>.
  <p>Elsewhere, you can find me on
